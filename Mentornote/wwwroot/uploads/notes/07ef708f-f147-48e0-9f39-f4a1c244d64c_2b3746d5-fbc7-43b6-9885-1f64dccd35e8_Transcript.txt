Look how freezy has uploaded a video. 
 Another food video. Weird food 
 combinations from YouTubers. He actually 
 did ask me for one, but I genuinely 
 don't have any. I'm quite a fussy eater. 
 And I told him, "Ask Josh because he did 
 this video a while back." So, let's see 
 what he has to eat. [Music] 
 There we go. Calreezy JJ's in it 
 in today's video as he definitely who we 
 got. Yeah, so he he did ask Josh. Okay, 
 so he did ask five of the side men and I 
 maybe he didn't. I don't know if he 
 asked Josh. I basically said to him, I 
 don't have anything, man. Like ask Josh 
 cuz he did the whole video. 
 The different creators what their 
 favorite weird food combination is. 
 All right, let's see it. No. Then I'm going to head there and 
 test them out and see are they actually 
 any good. 
 I made it to your house. It was like 
 getting into Fort Knox. Thank you for 
 having me. 
 My pleasure. 
 Your weird food combo is 
 pancakes and salt. 
 That's it. 
 I feel like when I asked you, you're 
 trolling me. There's no way that you 
 actually This must be the driest meal 
 ever. 
 No, bro. I loved it. No, I'm not even 
 lying. I did send you two other options. 
 But this is also another option that I 
 love doing. 
 This is this No, he's lying. He's lying. 
 He's lying. He's lying. He's like flat 
 out just lying. 
 So, and you're serious as in Wait, can 
 you get me a plate, please? 
 Okay. 
 No, he's lying. This He don't eat this. 
 He does love salt. He actually does love 
 salt. 
 Oh, so slippy. Was it raining outside? 
 It was actually It was a little bit, 
 bro. Come on. 
 There you go, bro. There you go. There 
 you go. There you go. I I just don't 
 believe that you're gonna just like 
 sprinkle that on. 
 Are you sure? 
 No, man. He's lying. He's lying. 
 Sugar cuz pancakes and sugar is a really 
 big thing. 
 Just I don't know. There's something 
 about it that just 
 He actually does like He genuinely does 
 love salt. Not like that. Like he This 
 is a weird thing about JJ. 
 I'm sure he won't mind me saying this. 
 He would sometimes 
 in the sea put the salt like the salt water in his 
 mouth. He wouldn't swallow it, but he'd 
 put it in his mouth just to have the 
 Yeah. 
 the wind up. 
 Disgusting. 
 One, I've never heard of this. 
 I don't think he does it anymore. 
 What does the salt do though? I don't 
 He don't eat that. There's no way. 
 There's no way. That reminds of childhood right now, 
 Mom. 
 Childhood. M 
 Oh my god. Maybe he actually does. 
 Now you're winding me up. 
 I'm not He does love soap. 
 Let me Let me try this again. 
 It just 
 [Music] Do you want some? 
 Look, there's no way 
 you think about it. 
 Can a cat eat soap? I mean, I'll be 
 honest. You can have it. Oh, you see not 
 this isn't even good enough to eat cat 
 food. Oh. Oh. Oh, wait. Hold on. Can I 
 eat that? Look at him, 
 bro. 
 I know. I know a cat could eat salt, 
 but I mean like that's a lot of salt. 
 Two out of 10. 
 Two out of 10. 
 Two out of 10. That's just awful. 
 How's it even 
 Maybe it's better when it's like hot. 
 The problem is not the temperature of 
 the food here. 
 Stop sniffing it, man. 
 Oh my god. He actually might eat that. 
 This cat is crazy. By the way, I feel 
 like we haven't spoken about the cat 
 here. This is one of the craziest 
 things. So, what would you like? 
 Seriously, out of 10. 
 Disgusting. 
 Eight out of 10. 
 Like, that's me being real, bro. 
 I mean, this 
 Okay, he has chosen the biggest YouTuber 
 and the weirdest food combination to 
 start the video. That is a zero out of 
 10. 
 This is a strong fail. This like doesn't 
 even come close to a pass. This is a 
 This is a strong fail. 
 That is like that's horrific. 
 Failure at its highest degree. 
 Hello Cal Freezy. Uh my weird food 
 combination is this. It is ready sorted 
 crisps and chocolate. The ideal scenario 
 is having the chocolate before the 
 crisps. You can go together, 
 but I would do chocolate before crisp. 
 But it's totally 
 I've had that. 
 Enjoy. 
 Now the weather today is stupendous. It 
 is beautiful. But as we get closer to 
 winter, it's something that always plays 
 on my m mind is during the winter 
 months, I end up struggling a lot 
 mentally. If you're looking for 
 something that's going to give you the 
 tools to really deal with that weird 
 dealing with stressful situations 
 things and that's where Better Help 
 really 
 is a combination one off the other 
 questionire after that they're going to 
 match you with a credentialed therapist. 
 And if you find that that person isn't 
 really for you, you want to try somebody 
 else. Well, great news is that you have 
 to extra It is over 7,000 reviews with a 
 Trust Pilot rating of over 4.3. So, you 
 know it's legit. Look, everybody goes 
 through highs in life, which are 
 fantastic, but also people go through 
 the lows in life as well. I mean, 
 going from 
 going from KSI and salty pancakes. 
 So, if this is something you think you 
 might be interested in, or you just want 
 to speak about help with somebody, well, 
 make sure you give Better Help a go. I'm 
 going to leave a link on screen right 
 now and a QR code right here. What 
 that's going to do is give you 10% off 
 your first month. I don't think I have 
 any. No, butter and honey on toast is 
 not weird at all. 
 Right, Theo, you are weird in many ways, 
 and this is simply just another one of 
 those. We've already seen weird food 
 combos from Theo. In fact, if you go 
 back to my death row video, you will 
 actually see he puts pizza in ice cream. 
 Yeah, weird guy. 
 So, yeah. What about a bit of 
 What about 
 cheddar and celery? Is that weird? cuz I 
 love that an 
 odd bowl. To be honest with you, having 
 salt and chocolate is not anything weird 
 at all. To be honest, some of the best. 
 That's the weirdest thing. Sea salt 
 chocolate. It's just a bit weird that he 
 said ready salted crisp 
 texture. 
 Either way, it's not weird, is it? 
 I actually have a weird feeling that 
 this is going to be one of the good food 
 combos. And I can see myself liking this 
 potentially. I've made my chocolate 
 ready salted sandwich. 
 That's some more people stuff. The 
 reason I like it is cuz my dad always 
 used to first ever dub. 
 What it is is the crisp provide like a 
 crisp a crunchy texture. What I do think 
 though we need more crisps like it's not 
 salty enough. So I'm This is going to be 
 quite disgusting to watch, but one sec. 
 Yeah, that's just it's not just bagging. 
 I'm not even lying. This is so good. 
 This weird food combo is 
 I don't have any. That's what I'm 
 saying. Harour absolutely. 
 He asked me to do this video like to 
 send him one and I was like I genuinely 
 just don't have anything that weird. 
 Lighten me. I'll be honest with you. 
 When it comes to food, the cream cheese 
 and celery list when it comes to 
 recommendations toast, 
 banana beer 
 food combination is exactly the type of 
 thing that he'd get right 
 and he has. 
 It's so good. 
 It's not weird. All right, I've got a 
 meal for you. And that is Hines baked 
 beans with rice. And you mix it in. You 
 warm it up. It's actually lovely. 
 Honestly, it might not sound like it, 
 but it is. 
 That 
 That isn't that weird either, I don't 
 think. I don't know. It's not that 
 weird. 
 But make sure that the rice is good 
 quality. Make sure the beans baked 
 beans. 
 Nah. Beans and rice is not normally 
 baked beans. 
 That's not It's not baked beans though. 
 Chipo crimes. 
 Have you committed a crime today? 
 I'm about to with my weird combination 
 of foods. 
 Okay, so I can see it. 
 Beans 
 and rice. 
 Okay. Now, normally beans and rice is 
 completely normal. 
 Normally, just want to put that out 
 there. Beans and rice can be amazing. 
 Thank you for saying that. Baked beans 
 and rice as in Hines beans and rice is 
 absolutely disgusting. And there is no 
 way on God's green earth this is 
 something that you ate. 
 That is something I ate and you just 
 don't have the vision to 
 What about 
 cheese and grapes? 
 Is that weird? No. Okay. 
 You understand? Like you don't have to 
 honestly I'm just trying to figure out 
 anything. We had to make a sandwich like 
 at school and I made a cheese. What was 
 it? cheese, grapes, and 
 water crest. 
 I don't even know what it was. I just 
 chose 
 used to have these exact rices in uni. 
 But by the way, I would like this would 
 be just the rice 
 as a sandwich. Exactly. A little bit 
 weird. 
 Microwave this. Eat it and I'll be done. 
 Oh, by the way, 
 don't eat cold beans. 
 Cold beans. A delicacy in all them. 
 Disgusting. 
 Genuinely unreal. 
 [ __ ] I genuinely love beans. I love 
 beans so much. Cold beans. Disgusting. 
 I've seen somebody spell weird wrong 
 before. Is that right? 
 Nah, I think you did that on purpose and 
 I've caught you out. Here we go, my one. 
 All right. I am very intrigued to see 
 how this rice. 
 I I honestly I would have done with some 
 better rice. So, you might be catching a 
 little bit of a blame here if this is 
 Well, if the rice is I just don't think 
 the rice is going to be the problem in 
 this meal. 
 I don't think anything's going to be the 
 problem, mate. It's just going to taste 
 like beans and rice and it's going to 
 taste really nice. And you're going to 
 get the beans in there. 
 That looks delicious. 
 Storm that I've cooked up. 
 First of all, I just I just want 
 everybody to fully understand this meal. 
 Yeah. 
 You know what it is? That's one of them 
 meals that looks delicious if I made it 
 like for me, but if someone handed me 
 that, I'd be like, "That looks a little 
 bit grim." But if I made it, 
 it's weird, but it don't 
 add some cheese on top of that. O, 
 you might need some salt on it just to 
 make bring out the flavors. 
 Yeah, grate some cheese on top. 
 There is no flavors, bro. 
 That isn't blind because it tastes like 
 tomato sauce. 
 That doesn't taste like tomato sauce. I 
 know that that's tomato sauce 
 in a rich tomato sauce, 
 but it doesn't taste like tomato sauce 
 is point. 
 Let's bring it back to this, too. One of 
 your five a day. So, not only have I 
 created a nice little meal that's easy 
 and cheap, I've just [ __ ] delivered 
 one of your five a day. Yeah. Oh my god. 
 Look at your body being taken care of. 
 Only four more to go. 
 I have to decide. Is this a pass or a 
 fail? 
 Oh [ __ ] bro. Please. 
 That's a pass. 
 You wanted weird food combos. It's got 
 to be like a pass, right? 
 That is a fail. 
 Hello. 
 All right. Because there is no there are 
 so many things beans go better with and 
 rice isn't one of them. 
 All right. Give me some. 
 Anyways, I'm giving out of 10 though. 
 Out of 10, I'm giving five. So, you're 
 on the line. 
 It's a It's a game of opinions. I'm 
 giving it a 10. 
 JJ's combo is like the f It's the only 
 weird combo so far. 
 So, now what's happened? It's ended up 
 with an average of 7.5. 
 Yes. Now, hello, Mr. Calreezy. I've got 
 a love experience in this department. 
 It's chocolate chip cookies with mustard 
 on top. So, you get a sweet chocolate 
 chip cookie, but then you get this weird 
 tang of mustard afterwards, which 
 surprises you cuz it's not bad. See, 
 that's that is finally that is a weird 
 one. 
 So, give it a go. 
 That's weird. 
 Next up. 
 Oh, damn. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Who do you think likes mustard on 
 chocolate? 
 Now, I feel like two things here. One, I 
 love English mustard, but two, I don't 
 think it's meant to be English mustard. 
 I think it's meant to be American chip 
 cookies. That sounds disgusting. 
 Yeah, I really 
 I don't think Josh likes it. No, I think 
 Josh chose cuz Josh has done this video 
 like years ago and I think he chose the 
 one that he was like, "This is super 
 weird, but it's kind of all right." 
 It is Josh. This is Josh's weird food 
 combo. He says he likes this as a in 
 between a snack and a treat, 
 you know. 
 Okay, man. Oh my god. You spread it 
 what? Like it's bread and butter. No, 
 this is foul, bro. 
 It's not. That is That is too much 
 English mustard. 
 Ain't no way you thinking I'm having 
 that. I hate mustard. And you've ruined 
 the cookie. Oh, this feels like a 
 forfeit, man. 
 This whole video has felt like a 
 forfeit. I'll be honest, mate. 
 Yeah, English mustard doesn't suit that. 
 American mustard would actually do 
 pancake and salt. That's That's a 
 forfeit, too. I'm not going to lie. 
 Cheers to uh 
 I'd rather eat this than pancakes and 
 salt. 
 [Music] No. [ __ ] It's a lot. 
 Little Djon. Little Djon mustard. Put a 
 bit. 
 Oh, that is horrid, boys. It's my nose, 
 man. 
 Yeah. You're not meant to use English. 
 It's a lot of mustard. I might have put 
 a bit too much. 
 Wasabi. 
 That's cuz that's what wasabi is in 
 England. 
 You don't bo even the cat ain't going 
 near that. 
 Oh, 
 it smells radish. 
 That's 
 the mustard though. 
 Oh, 
 can I just say something? It's not as 
 bad as your salt and pancakes. 
 What you going this is higher than salt 
 and pancakes. I think I've put too much 
 mustard on it. It's supposed to be more 
 of a lighter touch, 
 but 
 there what you're actually going for 
 second. Wow. 
 I don't mind it. Would you like to try 
 it with slightly less mustard? 
 What? Can I try it with the cookie? 
 Thank you so much. Appreciate that a 
 lot. 
 Yeah, go on. We can do that as a as a as 
 a treat. 
 You want a little mustard? There it is. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. 
 Is that it? Like it gives it a nice 
 little kick. 
 Mm- Horrible even then 
 you can't 
 grim. This is why I've never visited 
 this house, man. Honestly, man. 
 You reckon you're just going to [ __ ] up 
 loads of cookies and a big tub of 
 mustard? 
 Yeah. No, but it's already it's already 
 on there. Yeah. 
 And I'm like, 
 I've heard about this. Yeah, 
 I was warned about this meal. 
 This for me is another fail, 
 but I'd give it like a five. 
 Just been done dirty here, you know. 
 Minus one. 
 Minus one. Okay, that's the lowest 
 ranking we've ever had on the channel in 
 the history of the channel. So, thank 
 you. 
 Never again. 
 Never again. 
 Never again. 
 Okay. All right. 
 My favorite food combination is salty 
 chipsticks with tequila rosé. It is so 
 tasty. It's time for it to eat. 
 That does sound delicious. 
 How strange do you think? Sounds like a 
 That sounds like a alcoholic way of 
 eating like chips and milkshake. 
 Very strange. He was a large man once. 
 Still could be debated that he is now. 
 He has tequila roast. 
 Looking good, you know. 
 Chipsticks blended. 
 Does he? I'm not even joking. 
 I think I've heard this from the man 
 himself. 
 Not blended. 
 Not true though, is it? 
 I'm like 90% sure it is. He texted and 
 said, "What is your weird food company?" 
 And he he put this. 
 Oh, well, guess what? By the way, mate, 
 I brought my blender. 
 These are like unreal. 
 He doesn't blend it. These are a bottom 
 two. 
 He dips it. 
 All right, get that in there, Chip. 
 Oh my god. 
 They're not great, mate. 
 What? You really don't like them. 
 Tequila rosé as well. Like, 
 he doesn't blend. 
 Enough getting hammered here. Smell that. Are you sure he has this? 
 I'm not. 
 That's enough. We don't need anymore. We 
 don't need anymore. 
 Why did he say, "Are you sure he has 
 this?" 
 He just said he got the message. 
 Yeah, I reckon we needed more 
 chipsticks. Why? There's one survivor. 
 No, you just killed him. 
 Yeah, that's not it. They've done Ethan 
 so dirty. They've done Ethan and Josh so 
 dirty. 
 This 
 is absolutely vile. Let's How do you 
 even 
 Are you sure we have to have this? This 
 looks 
 like Angel. The reason it's chipsticks 
 is so he could dip it. Otherwise, it'd 
 be like Pringles or something. 
 It's like that a bit. 
 Why does it look all right, though? Why 
 does it The texture looks good. 
 I feel like I'm going to I'm going to 
 We're talking about vinegar with tequila 
 rosé. That's ultimately what it is. With 
 the worst texture possible, right? 
 Oh god, I'm 
 Cheers, bro. 
 Save the carpet there. 
 Good boy. Good boy. 
 I reckon Chip's going to like it. 
 Nope. Never mind. 
 [Laughter] 
 [ __ ] horrible. 
 That can't be someone's real thing. 
 Oh, got my [ __ ] B. How would he think that it's blended? 
 I don't believe that anybody in the 
 world was same person in the world was 
 happy. 
 There's no way that he eats that. Surely 
 he's done that to wind me up. 
 Belly means to bell end. 
 Hello. Um, so, uh, chipsticks with 
 tequila rosé. Are you [ __ ] serious? Not like that. 
 What do you mean not like that? 
 No. You're snacking with chipsticks, but you 
 chip. 
 Obviously. 
 I [ __ ] hate my producer, bro. That's 
 my bad. 
 That makes a lot more sense. 
 Now, I've I've just spewed up. I've just 
 spewed up like I don't I I I'm not going 
 to lie. I don't think the producer could 
 even be blamed for this 
 in the morning. 
 That's horri. All right, bro. Well, I 
 appreciate you. 
 I don't think the producer can be 
 blamed, 
 but cuz that is horrific. 
 Why? 
 Right. Well, we're we're all out of 
 tequila ros. 
 So, yeah, that's failed. 
 Hex with the five. Thank you so much. 
 Appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 That's a one of 10 in my opinion. on if 
 you 
 chipsticks and tequila ros. Did he say 
 blend it? 
 He No, 
 he didn't. He didn't say blend it. 
 It said I got sent two messages. 
 This says chipstick and tequila ros. 
 He text me and I said, "What is your 
 weird food colored?" And he put this. 
 You didn't have to use the blender. It 
 was there as an option. 
 Yeah, but it was there for a reason. 
 I was going to say when when Freezy 
 asked me about it, Freezy texted me 
 himself. 
 You wouldn't put that there unless you 
 were in that [ __ ] 
 We weren't going to blend the beans and 
 rice. 
 I feel sick. That was the worst thing I 
 think I've ever had. I'm still cupping 
 onto this [ __ ] 
 It's It was Yeah, it was bad. 
 It's a fail. A strong fail. But you can 
 have chipsticks by themselves. They're 
 all right. 
 They're gone. 
 They are good. 
 Then weird food combo. I mean, thing is 
 I'm the fussiest guy on the net. 
 However, I did have this weird little 
 phase where I'd keep going downstairs 
 and slap some potato waffles in some 
 bread and butter, which [ __ ] slapped. 
 But 
 not weird. 
 Lowkey kind of. This is a chip buddy. 
 Yeah, it's not weird. It is a chip 
 buddy. Hex five gifted again. Damn. 
 That's not That's That's normal. 
 All right. So, here we go. This right 
 here is AB's weird food combo. This is 
 what you sent me. 
 Horrible. 
 What do you reckon it is? Do you know 
 what it is? 
 No. No. No. No. But 
 I did panic a little bit when you me cuz 
 like I'm not really going to have that 
 weird. 
 Hex making it 20 gifted. Damn. Hex, what 
 are you doing? Thank you so much. I 
 appreciate it. Dabby's in chat for Hexo. 
 Am I with my palette? 
 This is weird. 
 Okay. I reckon it's dinosaur chicken 
 nuggets and chips on bread. 
 Right. Well, you got the bread bit, 
 right? 
 Oh, I can smell it. That's bad. 
 Yeah. Hold on a second. Sorry. It's got 
 This has been a takeaway mission, so 
 I've just got a 
 What is this? What? 
 Oh, that they're cooked to perfection, 
 bro. 
 Potato waffles right here. All right. 
 So, what 
 you don't understand how much I love 
 potato waffles. I was only at uni for 3 
 months. 
 I think I had at least four potato 
 waffles every single day. Sometimes I 
 had about 15. 
 Yeah. It's sometimes it was my 
 three bread and I brought butter because 
 surely butter on the 
 bread. Yeah. All right, cool. I did 
 think that. 
 Another five gift. 
 What are you doing? 
 Potato and bread. Yeah. 
 Yeah. Wait till you hear about 
 Thank you so much. It's literally a 
 chip. 
 That's literally what this is. 
 Wait, you know what? You just [ __ ] 
 blew my rocker off. 
 It's a chip buddy. 
 That was the bang though cuz waffles are 
 better than chips. I'm really bad at 
 like Look at that, bro. 
 Yo, I'm a Marge man. You know, this is 
 why. All right. So, 
 Oh, the roll over. 
 That's just cuz I can't be [ __ ] to 
 butter anymore. 
 Wait, that's quite smart. 
 Let me jump on this as well. 
 Yeah, you got to try that wave. 
 Yeah, I want to see how you butter it. 
 Smiley faces. Smiley faces were my 
 childhood. 
 I'm starving. 
 No, you got to try. 
 Look at that. This is what I mean. The 
 microwave 
 taught me. Can I show you? Thank you so 
 much. 
 You got to warm the butter up, bro. 
 With what? 
 With the by constantly doing this and 
 you warm it up and it melts on. Oh, 
 hurry up cuz I'm ready to get in, bro. 
 If this goes on, be fairs. 
 Oh, you're making these waffles cold. 
 Oh, do you know what? It's actually Oh 
 my god, it actually worked. 
 [ __ ] hell. I've done so many work. 
 Wait, what? You 
 You [ __ ] it up. 
 Stop messing. You did such a good job. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm I can say I'm getting really wound 
 up. 
 Sorry, mate. Just hold on. 
 You're not No, you're not going to 
 add some ketchup in this. Absolute 
 banger. 
 If the waffles cold, the whole thing is 
 a contrast. It melts the butter. It's 
 beautiful. 
 She getting emotional about the 
 Hi. Cheers. All right. Yo, cheers. 
 Banger. 
 Oh, wonder why that tastes. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Thing is, I don't want to I don't want 
 to hear Freezy say that the the beans 
 and rice had no flavor and say this one 
 does. 
 Waiting for nothing's going to kick in. 
 It's [ __ ] bread and potato. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 Oh god, I got it. 
 Wait till that butter and waffle kicks 
 in. 
 Oh, I bet AB doesn't eat crust either. 
 Another gift. 
 I like it with tiger bread. Have the 
 after. Try that. Oh, go on. Big Get them 
 [ __ ] waffling. 
 It's got your saliva on it. 
 But really enjoy the one. 
 It's actually good. 
 It's very good. 
 Very good. You didn't even have half a 
 bite before you said that. 
 Is it going to pass then? 
 What the? 
 Yeah, this is passive for sure. 
 That's all right. 
 All right, boys. Yeah, congrats. Uh, 
 that's a pass. Cheers. Nice one. Let's 
 move on. 
 Hey, Frieza, you got to try milk bean. 
 It's milk and ribbina together. All you 
 got to do is you replace the water with 
 milk. That's the ratio. And it's a great 
 combination. You know, it's kind of like 
 a milkshake but black currant flavor. So 
 enjoy that one. 
 Weird. Also not food. Weird. Kind of 
 would try this. You know, I don't like 
 milk. 
 Got the bougie milk for you. 
 Your tummy doesn't always agree with it. 
 Well, I'm lactose intolerant. 
 So, 
 this 
 and then I hate Ribina. So, 
 okay. Well, you know, there has been 
 things where I've combined two things 
 that I don't like and it turns into 
 something I do like. 
 Okay. This might be fire, you know. 
 So, I'll just put, you know, I'm not 
 going to I'm not going to spoil you. 
 It's obvious you're not going to drink 
 lots of it. Make sure your asshole's 
 okay. 
 Thank you, man. It's a nice color. 
 That I was literally going to say that 
 is nice. 
 So, what? You never liked Ryena as a 
 kid? 
 I love Ryina. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I love Ryina. 
 Sick. 
 I'm sure this won't do that. 
 Cheers to batch. 
 Yeah, this could be 
 Freez is a little bit stronger, I think. [Music] 
 Hear me out. Hear 
 me out. One second. I You know, you 
 don't you don't have to drink too much. 
 We know otherwise 
 that tummy is going to be 
 Okay. Well, that milk's now. 
 That's your milk. This is actually pretty good. 
 I want to try this. 
 I was expecting this to be the worst one 
 if I'm perfectly honest with you. 
 No way. What? Not the mustard and 
 cookies. 
 Nah, cuz that ended up working out okay. 
 This just I thought it would get all 
 like clumpy and disgusting. I like this 
 a lot, you know. 
 I mean, I'd love to have more of this, 
 but I feel like I'm going to suffer now. 
 Yeah, you can. 
 But it's good. 
 Out of 10. 
 I want to try this. 
 You know what? I'm giving that a nine. 
 Yeah. 
 [ __ ] nine. 
 Yeah, that's outstanding. This is 
 phenomenal. 
 I batch. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, the batch glaze has gone a little 
 crazy. 
 Maybe it's a bit too much. 
 Damn. 
 Batch. I'm going to give you a seven out 
 of 10 for this cuz it is actually quite 
 nice. 
 Boo, you want you want to try some? 
 I might try this on Snapchat. I might 
 try on Snapchat. I'll get Talia to try 
 it. I don't like milk, by the way. I 
 like milk in cereal and stuff like that. 
 And I like milkshakes and stuff. I hate 
 just milk. 
 Hex is another gift headed. 
 All right, look. That's getting a pass. 
 We got two fails in a pass here. 
 Bro, does this guy just roam anywhere? 
 Yeah, he he This is his house, man. 
 Okay. Hello, Callum. Uh, I've got a an 
 interesting food for you. It is a 
 delicacy. What you got to do is get some 
 tinfish of your choice. I would 
 recommend sardines. Uh, and then you you 
 get some toasted sourdough and then you 
 you you spread the sardines on the 
 sourdough. Uh, you can add what could 
 you add? Tabasco. Uh, a bit a bit a bit 
 bit of lemon juice. Enjoy. 
 All right. We'll just have bread. I've 
 not got a bread knife, so 
 No, it's okay. Cut it with a butter 
 knife, mate. That'll work. 
 This guy can't even clean his bedroom. 
 He's not going to be able to cut bread, 
 G. Film, you butchered it. Just admit 
 that this is wrong. 
 No, 
 no, it can't be, 
 bro. Give it. Trust the [ __ ] process. 
 What's the process? You've murdered this 
 piece of bread. 
 What do you mean? 
 What do you mean? What do you mean? 
 I feel like it's not actually that 
 weird, right? If you eat tin f like 
 that's a weird food that you've made a 
 bit more normal. But you have one each 
 and do what? Dip it in the [ __ ] 
 sardines. We're meant to make a 
 sandwich, lad. 
 Sardines 
 and half of a toasted piece of bread. 
 Half. 
 What you mean burnt? 
 Yeah, it's burnt as well. 
 So, here we go. This is what Harry asked 
 for. 
 Okay. So, what is it? So, it's sardines 
 spread onto the bread on top and then 
 Tabasco sauce. What a great shot, by the 
 way. 
 I mean, Harry loves tinned fish. It's It 
 doesn't appeal to me. And he loves it on 
 pizza as well. 
 Likes tinned fish. likes on pizza. 
 Doesn't like buttons. Something's 
 starting to seem a little bit odd about 
 the fella. 
 Something's a bit fishy with this guy. 
 Ah, she cuz it's fish. 
 Let me just put a bit of that on now. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Go and put a bit of tobasco on there. 
 Just a light touch. You wouldn't want it 
 to drown out the fishy taste. 
 This is going to be horrible. This is 
 going to be horrible. 
 Can I just say 
 it doesn't sound bad? 
 It looks a lot better than I thought it 
 was going to look. 
 I think the tobasco is making it better 
 cuz it doesn't smell as fishy. Now, 
 would you like to have a bite first or 
 should 
 No, I think you should cuz I'll be sick. 
 Oh god. You put quite a bit of tobasco on that. 
 Yeah, on purpose. Just a weird guy, 
 isn't he? 
 I quite like it. Let me tell you, you're 
 right. 
 The lime sauce has got rid of like the 
 crippling fishy. I will say that has 
 done has done that. Yeah, it's quite 
 if you don't if you don't mind fish. 
 I like the texture. 
 Not that weird. 
 You're glazing right now, bro. This is 
 not good. 
 I'm not having it. But you know, 
 [ __ ] 
 Wait. 
 Fish sardine sauce on my fingers. 
 Do you actually not like it? Seriously? 
 No. No, I don't like it. But I don't 
 like sardines, so maybe that's why I 
 don't. 
 Yeah, but I don't like sardines either. 
 But this has opened up my 
 guess it's opened up a can of sardines. 
 Uh, 
 would you give this a pass or a fail? I 
 would give it a pass, I think. Even 
 though I think it's horrible. In terms 
 of weird food combinations, I think it's 
 like I can see people having this. Yeah. 
 Not myself, but 
 I get the I get the vibe. Like if I like 
 sardines, I think this would be like a 
 movie. Like I this would be this is the 
 Christian. 
 God, am I a tinfish guy? 
 Oh, Harry. I'm 
 Harry loves tinfish. And when I say that 
 when he when I say he loves tinfish. 
 Wow. Takes get a pass, 
 I get a pass as well. 
 He literally gets like 
 a hamper worth 5.5 
 every month. 
 If you're talking serious food 
 combinations, look no further than Cocoa 
 Pops and warm milk. That is my favorite 
 food combo. That is the best one. No 
 arguing about it. 
 Not weird either. 
 Now, the fact that there is an argument 
 means it's not that weird cuz it's like 
 people. 
 Last one. 
 Cocoa pops. 
 Can't go wrong with that. Cannot go 
 wrong with that. 
 Now, this one is going to be a bit 
 controversial, but to me, you're missing 
 out JJ as well. Batches was weird. 
 Josh's was weird. Batch Josh and JJ's were genuinely 
 weird. 
 Bezes is like it's not I don't think 
 Bezes is that weird. It's weirder than 
 the rest of them, but I don't think it's 
 that weird because it is like he was 
 definitely just drinking and he had 
 snacks and it's like a milkshake. 
 Definitely classifies as a weird 
 YouTuber food. Cocoa pops with warm 
 milk. 
 This ain't weird. 
 Coco the Wait, that's normal though. 
 It's not though. Any cereal with warm 
 milk is bizarre. This is a cold milk. 
 That's normal. I've had that before. 
 It's basically a cocoa pops hot 
 chocolate. 
 That's disgusting. 
 Coco the monkey disagrees. Spell your 
 full name out loud. J O S H U A L A R K 
 I N. Where does Coco work out? 
 The jungle gym. 
 Uh, 
 shoot. 
 Would you have this? What? We're about 
 to have warm milk. Yeah, I would have it 
 cuz I was brainwashed by a big cereal. 
 I'd have it warm milk. Yeah, it's like a 
 hot chocolate. It's going to be 
 It's not though. That's disgusting. 
 Sorry. I feel like I don't get me wrong, 
 right? I'll have cold milk every day, 
 but I feel like it's 
 Yeah. Yeah. What it's going to do, it's 
 going to make the these soggy and grim. 
 I like when when I'm having my soup, I 
 like the crunch. That's the texture. 
 I I know that this is gross. I prefer it 
 soggy. 
 [ __ ] fish. Hate it when this 
 I cocoa pops. I make cocoa pops. Cold 
 milk. Leave it on the side for a minute, 
 mate. This is going to taste really. 
 Make a drink, chill for a minute. 
 People are just there like this is 
 normal. It's not normal. Cereal was made 
 to be cold. Look at it. Instantly. 
 Instantly. I'm so irritated. It's turned 
 into slush. The crunch is gone. 
 That looks beautiful. 
 I'm getting mad. Stop doing that. Don't 
 Don't do that. 
 Oh, relax. Relax. Look at you. 
 Oh, it's turning into slush. That's 
 disgusting. I'm sorry. That is 
 absolutely vile. If you are somebody 
 like put that it's swap. 
 I'm hearing minimal crunch, 
 mate. It is really good. 
 Oh. 
 Oh my god. 
 He's going to say it tastes awful. But 
 embrace it. Embrace it. Embrace it. 
 Like it can't taste that bad. 
 No. I'm so sorry. This is a crime. 
 You went in with a negative mindset that 
 enjoying it. I know it's going on you. 
 Hey, say you're too gifted. 
 Look, this is what it is. It's not 
 weird. It's just a much [ __ ] version 
 than cold milk. 
 It's not. It's giving you the warmth in 
 the belly that your mother 
 Can we just take a second to look at 
 this dart board? By the way, how are 
 there that many holes around the board? 
 Mother or father never provided. 
 What? 
 How about you giving this a pass or a 
 fail? 
 I'm obviously giving this a pass. This 
 is 
 Dr. Smith. Thank you so much for a 
 thousand bits. What's that for? Thank 
 you so much, love. Appreciate that. I 
 hope all is well with you. He's 
 brilliant. 
 I just don't see so many people in the 
 comments like, "Yo, Chip, I'm so with 
 him." Like, he's 
 I know the comments are going to erupt. 
 Put a comment down below. Is Cocoa Pops 
 better with warm? 
 It's better with cold. 
 Better with warm milk. 
 This is what I'm saying though. Create 
 just an inferior version of 
 because it's a different experience. 
 It's like when you ride a roller 
 coaster. Okay, it's fun, isn't it? 
 Guys, we're going to This for me was a 
 fail. 
 I'm giving it a 6 out of 10. For me, it 
 was a pass. I'll give it an eight. 
 See you guys on the next video. Bye-bye. 
 Okay, so JJ's was weird. 
 Theo's like, weirdness wise, JJ's is 
 like a nine out of 10. Theos is a zero 
 out of 10. Chips two out of 10. Josh 10 
 out of 10. Weirdest possible thing. 
 Ethan five out of 10. AB 1 out of 10. 
 Batch, 
 eight out of 10. Harry, four out of 10. 
 Toby, one out of 10. 
 That's what I'm saying. 
 I don't know if you agree with me, but 
 that's how I see the weirdness. Good 
 video, though. Enjoyed it. And it was 
 nice to see some other YouTubers as 
 well, like jumping in. Nice to see a few 
 of them.

what's happening guys today we're going 
 to calculate the future value and 
 present value of cash flows with the ba2 
 plus calculator on the third row of the calculator we 
 find the buttons needed to complete the 
 time value of money calculations 
 let's say you put one hundred thousand 
 dollars in an account for three years 
 the interest rate you earn on this money 
 is five percent if interest is 
 compounded annually 
 how much money will you have in the 
 account at the end of three years 
 first we'll indicate the total number of 
 compounding periods we have for this 
 problem 
 we have a three year time frame and 
 interest is compounded annually 
 so the number of compounding periods is 
 three 
 we'll enter this by first pressing three 
 then 
 n which represents compounding periods 
 in this calculator the interest rate is five percent we 
 enter this in by pressing five 
 then the i y button notice that we don't 
 enter five percent as 
 point zero five like we would if we were 
 doing this calculation manually 
 the time value of money function on this 
 calculator calls 
 for the interest rates to be entered in 
 this way now we'll need to enter the present 
 value it's important that we enter the 
 present value as a negative number 
 especially when we're doing more 
 complicated problems down the road 
 this is by convention for this and some 
 other calculators 
 that provide a time value of money 
 function a good way to think about this 
 is to imagine the money leaving your 
 hands and going into an account 
 it's a negative to you this may help you 
 visualize and remember 
 why present value for problems of this 
 sort need to be entered as a negative 
 number 
 so we'll press 100 000 make it negative 
 then press pv for present value 
 there is no payment in this problem so 
 the payment is zero now we want to calculate the future 
 value because we want to know 
 how much money we'll have at the end of 
 this three year period 
 so we'll press the cpt button for 
 compute 
 then fv for future value 
 and here we have 115 and 762.50 cents as our future value when we're done with one problem and 
 ready to do another 
 it's important that we clear out the 
 time value of money worksheet 
 we do this by pressing second then 
 pressing the button that says 
 clr tvm so now 
 when we go back and look we'll see that 
 our time value of money worksheet 
 is completely zeroed out we can verify 
 this by pressing 
 rcl for recall and then each of the time 
 value of money buttons 
 to verify that each value is set to zero 
 now let's assume that you expect to 
 receive a cash flow in the amount of one 
 hundred thousand dollars 
 two years from today the current 
 discount rate is three percent 
 annually what is the present value of 
 this one hundred thousand dollar payment 
 as we did in the first problem we'll 
 first enter the number of compounding 
 periods 
 the compounding convention here is 
 annual and the term is two years 
 so the number of compounding periods is 
 two we type two 
 then end the interest rate is three 
 percent 
 we enter three then i y 
 the future value will be one hundred 
 thousand 
 notice that the future value was entered 
 as a positive number 
 we can think about this as a positive 
 cash flow to us 
 there's no payment in this problem so 
 payment once again is zero 
 now we want to know what the present 
 value is 
 so we press cpt for compute then 
 pv for present value and here we see 
 that the present value of a one hundred 
 thousand dollar cash flow 
 two years from today discounted to 
 present with a discount rate of three 
 percent 
 is ninety four thousand two hundred 
 fifty nine dollars 
 and fifty nine cents this value is 
 represented as a negative number

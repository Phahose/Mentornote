hey what's up guys I'm going to show you 
 how I have my capture carard connected 
 from my PlayStation 5 to my PC for live 
 streaming through 
 OBS this is my current setup right now 
 right now I have a USB microphone 
 connected right to the 
 PC and I also have the Sony 3D 
 pulse USB dongle connected to the 
 PC PlayStation 5 of course you need one 
 of those make sure you have that what 
 you want to do is connect the HDMI out 
 of your PlayStation into the in of the 
 capture card and the out of the HDMI 
 into the in of the monitor or TV that 
 you want to show your 
 gameplay you want to make sure you have 
 your 3.0 USB cable it should to come 
 with your capture card connect to a 3.0 
 USB slot in your PC or Mac has to be a 
 3.0 cable into a 3.0 USB slot in my case 
 I'm using OBS you might using another 
 streaming software but there is no Drive 
 necessary now that you have your capture 
 card connected to your PC and your 
 PlayStation is turned on you want to go 
 to OBS and start adding the capture 
 device so first thing is you go down 
 here to the add new source and it's 
 going to be a video cap video capture 
 device and let's call this 
 PS5 okay hit okay and we want to use the 
 USB video and then there it is you hit 
 okay so there you go you have video 
 now so you can see down here actually 
 that you are getting signal for the PSR 
 audio signal but there's no desktop 
 audio I'm not getting anything in my 
 headset right so what you want to do at 
 this point is go under Advanced Audio 
 properties and under audio monitoring 
 for the desktop desktop audio click 
 Monitor and output and for the PS5 also 
 Monitor and output 
 there you go now we have audio coming 
 through my headset hit close you can see 
 the audio signal is bumping which is 
 great I'm using the Sony 3D pulse 
 headsets again and if you are using this 
 you got to make sure that you have 
 monitor also turned on on your headset 
 here there's a off and I'm sorry yeah an 
 off and monitor switch that you want to 
 turn on that way you can control the 
 volume also in the headset because if 
 you lower the volume here that will 
 affect the output of the audio which you 
 don't want obviously you want you know a 
 really good sounding stream but if you 
 if it's too loud it's too low you have 
 the monitor turned on your headset you 
 control the actual volume I put in here 
 in your headset which is way better and 
 that's it you're ready to go you're 
 ready to stream just make sure you have 
 everything connected set up whatever 
 platform you're going to stream on and 
 hit go you're very welcome and thank you 
 for coming by and checking out my video 
 have a nice day

I don't like it. Genuinely. Genuinely. I love the baton on their skulls. Have you seen that guy's back? The worst people are the ones that put synthol. You know synthol? Synthol, this is what they can't afford their skulls to run. So they inject oil in their muscles to make their muscles look big. So, you know, their muscles are not like pure water. So if you press it like this, if you press it like this, until it's synthol. Look at synthol. Synthol men. They look very weird. No matter how much you see tone, you see veins. You're just like a bag of water. I'm telling you. These people exist. And they walk amongst us. So when I see them, there's a guy that I've seen in the gym two days now. He's like a black boy. When he goes to the gym, he's very dedicated to the gym. He doesn't talk to anybody. I wasn't watching him because I didn't know what to do. So I started looking at this boy. See what this boy is doing. I was doing exercises. I just find it mind-numbing. I just started people watching. So I was watching this boy. This boy would take things seriously. He would tie his waist. I don't know gym etiquette. So you can't tie the waist. I meant for bench pressing. He would tie it to his waist and start doing pull-ups. I'm thinking, are you allowed to do that? Are you allowed to do that? Should I report him? Should I report him? And I just find people around me, I see a man. I'm also scared because of TikTok. TikTok has traumatized me. This creep is looking at me. So that's another reason why I don't like the gym. TikTok has traumatized me. I thought gym was so dark. So every time I'm in the gym, I won't get up. I'll put my head down. I'll put my head down. I'll put my head down. I'm afraid to make eye contact. People will say he's a creep. And I just calm. People are talking in general. Boy is different. Boy is different. I don't know who will say he's a creep. Maybe. I'm very new to the gym. I'll put my head down. I'll put my head down. I'll pick my weight. I'll pick the weight I was picking. And me, I don't ego lift. I don't care. If people are paying 100 pounds, I'll pay 20 pounds. I don't care. I can do the gym exercise. I can do the ego lifting. I can do the Dwayne Johnson. Because you can carry. You can carry. You can curl it. I carried, I'll curl it. I feel like I can do it now. For the next day. For two days, Christine. No more body pains when your muscle is paining you. I think my hand was like this. My hand was like this. I was walking like this. I had to walk like this. My hand. Normal gym pain is when you can move it. You can move it but it's painful. And now it's fine. That was expected. I thought I had torn a muscle. The thing is that normal gym pain lasts a day at worst. But the next day it's getting better. This was lasting three days. My hand was like this constantly. I'm telling you Christine. That's not normal gym pain. That's not normal gym pain. I'm normal gym pain. You train your interiors. You don't train your muscles. Because I don't know what I care to do. You like what they call it. They call it functional strength. It's like you can fly in the real world. You need to run. I was on a treadmill today. The gym has many things. It's a good gym. I was looking at the fitness classes. I don't know the fitness classes. Go! Go! Go! Next movement. I was thinking. This is pretty interesting. Maybe I can join the class. They were not doing some weird activities. They just looked like. It looked like. It looked like. It looked like. It looked like. It looked like. Except the instructor. Except the instructor. It looked like they were struggling. It looked like they were struggling. I was like. They have boxing classes. I walked into the boxing gym. I saw the coach. He asked me if I was interested in boxing. One of my friends told me to go. I told him I was a professional boxer. He told me to embarrass myself. I told him to stand up straight. I told him stand up straight. Stand as you punch. You said you were standing still. How will you stand? The dominant hand is your right hand. I think you will stand like this. I think you will stand like this. This is so weird. You stand like this. You stand like this. You tell him to punch. You tell him to stand like this. Punch 2 is your other hand. Do like this, put your body into it. Punch 3, this is your other hand. The hook. Punch 4, do like this. Don't drop your guard. Because it's heavy. It's not light, it's heavy. At all times. At all times. So if you punch like this. Punch 3 is like this. Punch 4 is like this. Hook. You have to hook the person's head. Punch 4 is like this. Punch 5 is uppercut. You tell him to go like this. You're not getting it. Go down and come up. You tell him to go down. Go down and come up again this way. So now, punch 5 and 6. Don't go like this. Do like this. 7 and 8 is body shot. So the same thing as 3 and 4. 7 and 8 is this way. Hook downwards. You're punching the person. 8 is this way. So Iman will tell you. We're going 1, 3, 8. Let's go. 1, 3, 8. What kind of animated thing is this? You look like you're playing a video game. You look very silly. I felt foolish in that place. I felt like I was learning something. I felt like I was improving. I felt like I was learning something. In the gym, I felt like I was losing my IQ points. I felt like I learned something. But I don't think your opinion is wrong. I live there. Some people have a lot of signs. They're training the gluteus macus. They're training the short toe. You have to target it by putting your hand at aторы angle They're doing full mass or full sides? They're doing full mass. They're doing full sides. Those two things don't apply to people who don't have good genetics Africans... I don't think I am good. Africans have more advantage in terms of genes than white people. White people don't have good genetics. So they have to go into the... Forget slavery. Forget... It's because we're all for monkeys. That's why. Obviously Baboon Baboon have... Anyways, that's not the point. The point is that those technical things apply to those white people that don't have... The greatest bodybuilder in the world is black. There's one of that man. One of the greatest. No. How many black bodybuilders in the industry do you know right now? Look, I said Ronnie Coleman. He's a black man. First name. I know the man. He's a black man. What's his name? What's his name, Seth? Matt Wentz. Matt Wentz. That's not the point. And again, that's kind of like a white person activity. It's very wise. Very wise dominators. Plus, we don't care for their health. We don't care for their health. We don't care for their health. We see mostly white people there. We see mostly white people in marathons. Are you silly? Are you silly? Are you silly? We don't care for their health. Who are they? I don't know. Most obese... You're more likely to see an obese white person than an obese black person. Black people don't go too far. White people go too far. Black people are just fine. How many black people do you know is out there caring for their health? How many black people do you know go to the gym regularly? When I went to the gym, a lot of black people were there. How many white people do I know that go to the gym personally? Regularly. Sosa used to go to the gym before he could not afford it again. One of my close friends used to go to the gym. A lot of my friends are black. They don't care for their health. They don't care for their health. I went to Cameroon. I went to Cameroon. I went to Cameroon. I debunked your point. I debunked your point. I debunked your point. Even Michael Phelps, not a white man, goes to every sport. Even athletics are dominated by blacks. I know black Americans because they are cultural. Okay. If you go into every sport, all sports have their race dominated. Most track and field sports are dominated by black people. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes, that's why. Yes, that's why. If football is a very mixed sport, football is very mixed. Most football players are white. The person that won the Ballon d'Or is black. What are you saying? The nominee was not even white. He was not even white. But he is not white. He is not white. He is not white. What are you saying? Your point is not making sense. You are proving it. You don't want to be big. I don't want to look big. It's not my interest to look big. There are a lot of black within fitness content creators. There are a lot of black fitness content creators. She is black. She does fitness content. You are a black. You are a pro black. I am not a pro black. I am just saying your point is invalid. Your point is invalid. You are just chatting worse. My point is valid. A lot of people rely on their genetics. A lot of them rely on their genetics. A lot of them actively work towards making themselves better. Because we don't have to. We don't have to. It's like someone that naturally in school, there are some students that can study for 2 minutes and get up and study for 5 hours. Same thing with black and white people. When you put in the effort to be the best of the best, that's the difference. For example, a lot of people wear sunscreen because of their melanin. But apparently, if you wear sunscreen, you get it from black people. But if you just use it, it's still good to wear sunscreen. That's what black people rely on. They rely on their genetics to make themselves better. To motivate themselves. I don't need to try as hard with the ultra-technical, ultra-colossus. You don't need to try as hard. Because generally, going to the gym for most people is just to not be fat and to keep fit. No, a lot of people are there. When I say going to the gym, they are actively hoping it was a goal. Hoping it was a goal of a body physique. Yes, it's not just for health. A lot of people are going there to be healthy. Me, I'm going there to be healthy. That's why you're being confused now. You're going there to be bored. I'm going there to be healthy. A lot of people go there because they live a life that when you're 95, you go to your office and a lot of people don't have sports. You go to your office, you sit in your desk, you come home, you lie in your bed, it's not good for the health. Your arteries will start clogging because you're moving up and down. So a lot of people go to the gym. Even if you go to the gym, a lot of people are just there, going to the gym, just walking. Some people have their own different goals in life. Some people are going to the gym to be hench, fair. Generally, in my head, the whiter you get, the dumber your IQ is. That's just how I see it. I know it's wrong, but that's the unconscious bias I have. If I see someone that is very warm, I just think that their longevity is non-parametric. My strength is too much. That's how I classify them. My strength is too much.

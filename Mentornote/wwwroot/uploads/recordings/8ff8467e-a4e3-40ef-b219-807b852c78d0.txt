If you start talking, at the moment it's not even recording you, you'll be talking. Welcome class to page chapter 1 of business law. So today we are going to be covering civil law and common law. The civil law is only practiced in Quebec and it was made during the French civil times. The civil law uses a central code. It is used to govern private laws in Quebec. In this civil law, they don't follow other things other judges have said. The precedence of a different judge is not binding. The precedence of civil code is what is binding. But in the common law, they use stereotypes, which means following precedence, where the decision of a court is binding in all courts of a lower hierarchy, so long as the facts of the case are the same.
